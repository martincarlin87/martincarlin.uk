  .notification > button.delete {\\n      border: none;\\n    } \\n\\nwhich is strange as it seems fine on the Bulma site.\\n\\nIn addition to this, I added a new modifier class in the naming

I am constantly updating this page and it's quite lengthy at the moment but please have a read and feel free to let me know what you think.\\n\\nAs you might imagine, I receive a fair amount of enquiries from recruiters and I find myself now saying the same things over and over, so I thought that putting something here that I can link to might be useful so that it doesn't take me as long to reply.\\n\\nI genuinely don't mind anyone getting in touch via email or LinkedIn as then I can reply whenever and wherever I like, but it seems to be the opposite with every person who gets in touch wanting *'5 minutes'* on the phone. The problem with that is that at least with emails and messages I can try and reply to everybody and treat them equally, with phone calls I can manage a couple before it becomes a chore and a distraction (i.e. from work), especially since I often have to find a quiet area to take the call away from my desk. (Cold) Calling from a withheld number doesn't really help either. \\n\\nAlso - don't chase me on my work phone by going through the directory tree, that's happened only a couple of times but you are off your rocker if you expect someone to talk openly about new roles when they could be sitting next to their boss.\\n\\nTaking calls also tends to be a complete waste of time as 95% of roles that I am contacted for are either not suitable, I have been contacted about the same one before from someone else, or just not of interest for one reason or another.\\n\\nTherefore, the way I like to approach it is to receive any roles you wish to send (with job spec) that you think I am suitable for and if they are something that I do want to go ahead with, that's when we can arrange a call to discuss. This helps to save us both time I'm sure.\\n\\nIf you are contacting me, please send the following rather than being secretive and requiring a handful of messages to find out all the information I need (although I can understand and sympathise, but I can confirm that I am not a recruiter looking to steal your contacts):\\n\\n\\n- **- Name of the company**\\n- **- Salary range**\\n- **- Any benefits or perks**\\n- **- Location**\\n- **- Working hours**\\n- **- Technology stack - what's required and what can be learned**\\n- **- Culture**\\n- **- Dress code**\\n- **- Possibilities of working from home on occasion**\\n- **- Job spec**\\n\\nThe reason for requiring these is that there is no way I can make an informed decision about whether to proceed any further without knowing all of the above.\\n\\nTo cut to the chase and help narrow things down, I am not interested in working for an organisation caught up in red-tape that requires business dress to sit behind a desk and code.\\n\\nI currently work 9 - 5 at the moment so I'm also not that keen if the role is 9 - 5.30 for example but it depends on the individual role, some I have been offered have meant a minuscule increase when you factor in those extra hours over the course of a year, so it definitely wasn't worth the move.\\n\\nI have had recruiters in the past take a condescending attitude about asking about trivial things such as working hours because the privilege of working for their client should be enough to disregard it but I think it's definitely important when you consider the above, what if I never bothered to ask and only found out when I received the contract?\\n\\nI also like to work on Macs so if it's Windows PCs that are used then again it's not of much interest, sorry - once you go Mac you don't go back.\\n\\nI am based outside of Glasgow (Motherwell) so roles in Edinburgh are also not particularly of interest. It would also be a bonus if the role was commutable by car (i.e. some form of parking provided or affordable near by) in order to avoid having to pay for public transport on top of my own.\\n\\nAlso, I have been using Ruby on Rails in my current role so if the role involves PHP then it's wise to point out that in any role I have used PHP, it's always been custom in-house 'frameworks' that I have worked on, so even though I know PHP, I haven't had a chance to use any of the modern stuff professionally but I am using Laravel for a freelance project.\\n\\nPersonally, I don't think frameworks are an issue but it's whether that is deemed acceptable from the hiring company or not if it's an issue for them.\\n\\nThe only other thing to mention is that roles involving front and back-end work would be preferential as opposed to ones that are purely one or the other.\\n\\nI appreciate that all sounds extremely fussy but there is not much point in changing jobs if it's not better in almost every aspect from my point of view.\\n\\nI know that I have spoken to a lot of recruiters recently and I appreciate what you have sent and always attempted to be open and honest about any roles I've been approached about, but nothing has caught my eye so far. A lot of the time it's hard to tell what the companies are like or what they actually do because their websites aren't very informative and the generic spiel about how good the client is doesn't really offer much either as every single company is innovative, exciting, etc.\\n\\nI also look up companies on Glassdoor, so if they have a lowscore on there then that sets of alarm bells, particularly if there have been one or more rounds of redundancies.\\n\\nOne thing that I have found annoying is recruiters getting in touch and then I reply with my thoughts and then I don't hear back (probably because of the fussiness, but I only want to make a move for the right job), until the next time I update my CV on Monster and then they conveniently forget about that time where they never got back to me.\\n\\nChances are, even if you come back with the perfect role then I won't be interested.\\n\\nThere has even been a case of me being interested in a role and not hearing back so I'm not sure what the etiquette is there - apply direct?? (The role wasn't news to me since I had been contemplating applying directly for months but I was prepared to go through the recruiter when they got in touch about it.)\\n\\nI think that's everything, thanks for reading!\\n\\nCheers,\\nMartin\\n\\n\\n\"}]],\"sections\":[[10,0]]}","html":"<div class=\"kg-card-markdown\"><p>Hello there!

I am constantly updating this page and it's quite lengthy at the\nmoment but please have a read and feel free to let me know what you think.\n\nAs you might imagine, I receive a fair amount of enquiries from recruiters and I\nfind myself now saying the same things over and over, so I thought that putting\nsomething here that I can link to might be useful so that it doesn't take me as\nlong to reply.\n\nI genuinely don't mind anyone getting in touch via email or LinkedIn as then I\ncan reply whenever and wherever I like, but it seems to be the opposite with\nevery person who gets in touch wanting '5 minutes'  on the phone.

The solution seems to be creating the `bootstrap/cache` directory but of all the tutorials and blog posts I read, none mentioned it so I'm not sure if this is a recent change since the `.gitignore` file has `/bootstrap/cache` in it but a 5.1 project I have doesn't.\\n\\nI think the rest is fairly self-explanatory, just replace the placeholders in the square brackets, the curly brackets are actually used by Deployer so don't change those!\\n\\nThis example is made a bit more complicated due to using elixir for assets, so that's why we have to have a task that runs `npm install`.\\n\\nI also wasn't sure what to do with the `.env` file since it's not in source control and obviously your local one will be based on a local environment, not production, so I decided just to create a `.env.production` file that gets uploaded and renamed to `.env`.

I didn't even notice that\ninclude before so I'm glad I went back to have another look at this.\n\nAfter that I setup some variables at the top to avoid any confusion over what\nneeded updating for individual use cases.\n\nI also followed the Laravel recipe and included the .env  in the shared_files \narray.\n\nThe biggest change after that was to simply upload the public/build  directory\nand its contents over having to do npm install  and then gulp --production.\n\nThis makes the deploy significantly  quicker and it also saves you having to\ninstall node and npm on production, as well as not having a node_modules \ndirectory for every release which would take up a significant amount of room.\n\nI was still having issues with the bootstrap/cache  folder after my re-shuffle,\nso I removed that line from the top level .gitignore  (can't remember if it was\nme that added that or not, but looking at Laravel's .gitignore\n[https://github.com/laravel/laravel/blob/master/.gitignore]  it must have been\nme) and that helped and saved needing a further task in the deploy.
